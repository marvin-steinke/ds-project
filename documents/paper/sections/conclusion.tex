In this article, we simulated Souza et al.'s \cite{souza2023} ecovisor and
integrated it into a Mosaik co-simulation. This design abstracts the physical
implementation and allows for the interaction with various simulators, such as
simulated virtual energy resources or simulated consumers. To integrate real
applications into this environment, we have enabled SIL and HIL capabilities by
exposing the ecovisor API through a FastAPI server that is connected to a Redis
database. We have devised a cost-effective and time-efficient approach for
testing and developing carbon-aware applications that that does not require a
physical ecovisor implementation. In order to assess our approach, we generated
test cases by utilizing recorded solar and carbon data. These tests aimed to
showcase the ecovisor model's implementation accuracy and its capability to
transfer data correctly between the model and other systems.
