While our approach focused on a single simulation of the Ecovisor, our use of
Mosaik demonstrates its effectiveness for large-scale smart grid simulations. In
future research, we suggest interconnecting multiple Ecovisor systems to share
resources and further reduce carbon emissions. This network could be distributed
across different geographic regions, as carbon intensity varies depending on
location. By incorporating carbon information services like Electricity Maps
\cite{electricity_maps}, this could enable carbon-efficiency optimizations such
as Letâ€™s Wait Awhile \cite{wiesner2021} or Cucumber \cite{wiesner2022} from
Wiesner et al. This would enhance the potential for carbon reduction at a larger
scale.
