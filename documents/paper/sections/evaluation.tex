To assess the effectiveness of our system, we conducted a two-part evaluation using open-source real-world data. We designed two example cases to demonstrate the simulation capabilities of Ecovisor and showcase how the implemented API can be used by consumers. To improve the clarity of the data presented in our examples, we scaled down the Photo Voltaic (PV) data to approximately 30\% of its original values. This allowed us to better showcase the API usage and plotted graphs. Scaling down the input data did not impact the simulation itself, as we could simply assume that less solar power was available due to weather or limitations of the solar power generators.

In the first part of our evaluation, we demonstrate the general functionality of the Ecovisor model and showcased how the output changed with varying input of the energy mix.\\
 In the second example, we highlighted a missing functionality of the API by demonstrating how a workload application can set the \textit{battery\_charge\_rate} and \textit{battery\_max\_discharge}.
 
To enhance the comprehensibility of our evaluation, we included two plots visualizing the output data from the simulation. One plot was included for each example, helping to clearly illustrate the results of our evaluation.

\subsection{Ecovisor-Model with changing energy input}
%TODO Hier die erste grafik

The first example showcased the general functionality of the Ecovisor model and how the output is affected by changing availability of different energy sources. For this simulation, we utilized an example carbon data to determine the amount of carbon emitted when using grid energy and a solar energy input file, which was scaled down to one-third of its original value. Starting from second 200, we further scaled it down until the output was under the total consumption of the workload application. In addition, we set the \textit{battery capacity} to 0.3 KW/h and the \textit{battery\_charge\_level} to 0.15 KW/h.

In the plot, we can observe that the \textit{Grid Power} output is opposite to the PV Power output until second 200. This is because when enough PV energy is available, the surplus energy is fed into the energy grid, resulting in negative carbon emission. During the first 200 seconds, the workload application's consumption is stable at 500 KWs and doesn't change throughout the simulation. Although this isn't ideal in a real-world scenario, it allowed us to more easily demonstrate the functionality of the model.

In the first third of the simulation, until second 100, we can see that there is enough PV energy to run the workload and feed some extra energy into the grid. However, the Battery Charge Level isn't high enough to load the battery consistently. Around second 100, the PV Energy level rises, and the battery starts charging until second 200. At second 200, the PV Energy level drops, and the workload application uses the energy in the battery and from the available PV energy to meet its demands. Around second 350, no PV Energy is available, and the workload only runs on grid power until the end of the simulation. The battery doesn't charge since it only charges with PV energy.

This example demonstrates how the Ecovisor model behaves with different available energy sources. It charges the battery when enough PV energy is available and uses all other available energy before utilizing grid energy to reduce carbon emission.
