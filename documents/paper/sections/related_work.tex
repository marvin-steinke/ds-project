Beilharz et al. \cite{beilharz2021} developed Marvis, a testing framework for
distributed IoT applications. Marvis provides realistic staging environments for
IoT applications by using a combination of virtual and physical nodes that
communicate via virtual or physical networks. The domain environments in Marvis
are modeled after the real-world environments in which the IoT applications will
be used, and Marvis integrates simulators, emulators, and hardware testbeds to
model the expected behavior of these environments. The experiments are executed
in wall clock time to evaluate the timing effects of physical components.
Beilharz et al. use hybrid co-simulation to integrate simulators into the
testing environment, which involves the synchronized execution of systems with
both discrete-event and continuous time behavior.
