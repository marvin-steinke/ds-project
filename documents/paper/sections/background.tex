\subsection{Co-Simulations and Mosaik}
%The use of Mosaik brings several benefits compared to traditional simulation
%methods. It offers a more flexible and scalable simulation environment, enabling
%the integration of multiple components and the simulation of large-scale
%systems. Furthermore, it offers a more accurate representation of the energy
%system, incorporating real-world data and parameters, which can be used to
%validate the performance of the Ecovisor.
