One approach to address virtual energy systems and software defined control was
made by Souza et al. with their "ecovisor". This ecovisor allows each
application to handle clean energy's unreliability in software based on its
specific requirements. A small-scale prototype - on the right - was created and
evaluated, showing that multiple applications can concurrently exercise their
virtual energy system in different ways to better optimize carbon-efficiency
based on their specific requirements. [30s]

Mosaik is an open-source co-simulation framework that allows users to simulate
large, complex systems by combining multiple simulations of smaller, simpler
components. It enables the integration of various simulation models and allows
for the communication and synchronization of these models in a seamless and
efficient manner. Mosaik's importance for research lies in its ability to
simulate large and complex systems that would be difficult or infeasible to
model using a single simulation tool. It allows researchers to combine different
models to study the interactions and performance of the overall system. On the
right for example, a smart grid simulation demo can be seen that involves a
grid, households, and photovoltaic panels. These entities are represented by
spheres in the simulation and are connected according to the layout of the
scenario. The color of the spheres changes based on the current value of each
element. [60s]
