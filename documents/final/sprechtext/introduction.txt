As we continue to rely on technology in our daily lives, the energy consumption
of data centers has become a significant concern. Data centers are responsible
for a large portion of global carbon emissions, and it is crucial that we take
action to reduce their environmental impact. Today, we will be discussing the
concept of carbon- and renewable-aware computing by utilizing virtual energy
systems and software defined control to optimize carbon-efficiency. By
integrating this concept into a co-simulation framework, we can improve the way
we model and predict the behavior of physical systems and their interactions
with other systems by utilizing this technology. [40s]
